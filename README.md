# DCGAN-mnist

This repository contains an implementation of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) that generates digits that look like those from the MNIST dataset. It is based on the paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala.
